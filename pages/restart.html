    <h2>Restart my blog, and continue write something</h2>
    <p>
      Today is my first day to wake up before 5 o'clock and then start to do something. 
      Maybe I drank so much coffee in the daytime, so I woke up so early. 
      I dreamed a dream, my teammate posted something about she is gonna resign in "Moments", the reason is she wanna spend some time getting another major's degree. And then I saw another person stranger which is someone my friends' friends post something about her. 
      The post invloved that she is one of their basketball team and she is a Guard ðŸ˜†.
    </p>
    <p>An interesting dream ðŸ˜… , and why such a dream?ðŸ¤”</p>
    <p>Anyway, it's a good chance to let me get up early and do something.
       So I wanna read books or do some leetcode and restart my blog!ðŸŽ‰</p>
