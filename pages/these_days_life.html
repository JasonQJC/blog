    <h2>these days life</h2>
    <p>
      It seems that my work can't make me happy. 
      But sorrow didn't surround me all day. 
      I guess that's because of busyness. 
      When busyness is gone, 
      the thought that I don't like my work and that it's not meaningful comes out of my mind.

      One week ago, I slid down when riding a motorcycle. 
      It rained one day ago, and some slippery things in that corner. 
      And I didn't notice that. 
      I used the brake in that corner when at 60km/h speed. 
      So I slid down. Luckily, I wore a knee pad. 
      So only little hurt got, if the knee pad can be tighter, I guess there will almost be no hurt. 
      After that experience, I still love the motorcycle. 
      I bought a new knee pad to protect me better and I will keep riding it. 
      Motorcycle means a lot to me.

      Last week I meet a new friend. 
      It seems we feel happy when we talk face to face. 
      But after we say farewell, we don't contact. 
      We all are lonely souls, when we meet, loneliness disappears at that moment. 
      When we leave each other, we are still lonely.
